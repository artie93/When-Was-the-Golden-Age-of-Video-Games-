# When-Was-the-Golden-Age-of-Video-Games?

In this project, I showcased my proficiency in data analysis using SQL, this time focusing on analyzing game sales and reviews data. 
I retried information such as top-selling games, average critic and user scores per year, and identified years with significant game releases based on review counts. Further, I employed various SQL functionalities to derive meaningful insights, such as determining top years based on critic and user scores, and correlating these with game sales figures. 
This project highlighted my ability to manipulate and interpret complex datasets to uncover actionable insights, making me adept in leveraging SQL for data-driven decision-making and analysis.
